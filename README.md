# How to Pull the full code

Make a folder on your device (let's say Pull Code) and pull the backend first from the link->https://github.com/shadow855/task-management-backend.
After that make a folder named-> frontend in the root folder (Pull Code Folder) and pull this frontend code in it.

## How to Run
Before running make .env variables in the root folder (Pull Code) for backend, which are->
1. PORT
2. MONGO_URI
3. JWT_SECRET
4. NODE_ENV

And, make this .env in the root of your frontend folder-> REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000

Now,
In the root project directory, you can run:
### `npm start` to run the backend.

Move to frontend directory using cd frontend command in  root project directory, and run frontend using->
### `npm start`
